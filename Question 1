#Question 1

myfamily = ("mother", "father", "sister", "brother", "sister") 

print(myfamily) 
print(type(myfamily))
print(myfamily[2])
#myfamily.append('me')
#in tuples we can't access to append function, because it relates to arrays(list) data type
#myfamily.pop('brother')
#in tuples we can't access to pop function, because it relates to arrays(list) data type
